# Expanation of this code

# Functions
# make_file(filename):
# Purpose: Creates a new file with the specified name.
# Implementation:
# Tries to create a new file using the open function with mode "x" (exclusive creation mode).
# If the file is created successfully, it prints a success message.
# If a file with the same name already exists, it prints an error message.
# If any other error occurs, it prints a generic error message.
# check_list():
# Purpose: Lists all files in the current directory.
# Implementation:
# Uses os.listdir() to get a list of all files and directories in the current directory.
# If no files are present, it prints a message indicating so.
# Otherwise, it prints the names of all files in the directory.
# write_file(filename):
# Purpose: Writes user input to a specified file.
# Implementation:
# Checks if the specified filename is a file using os.path.isfile().
# If it is a file, it opens the file in write mode and writes user input to it.
# If the file does not exist, it prints an error message.
# Handles FileNotFoundError and other exceptions, printing appropriate error messages.
# read_file(filename):
# Purpose: Reads and prints the content of a specified file.
# Implementation:
# Tries to open the file in read mode.
# Reads the file content and prints it.
# Handles FileNotFoundError and other exceptions, printing appropriate error messages.
# delete_file(filename):
# Purpose: Deletes a specified file.
# Implementation:
# Tries to remove the file using os.remove().
# Handles FileNotFoundError and other exceptions, printing appropriate error messages.
# Update_file(filename):
# Purpose: Updates the content of a specified file.
# Implementation:
# Tries to open the file in write mode.
# Writes user input to the file.
# Handles FileNotFoundError and other exceptions, printing appropriate error messages.
# Main Program
# main():
# Purpose: Provides a menu-driven interface for the file management system.
# Implementation:
# Continuously displays a menu with options to create, write, read, update, list, and delete files, or exit the program.
# Based on the userâ€™s choice, it calls the appropriate function.
# If the user chooses to exit, it prints a closing message, waits for 3 seconds, and then terminates the program.
# If the user inputs an invalid option, it prints an error message and prompts the user to select a valid option.
# Execution
# The main() function is called at the end of the script to start the program.
# The user interacts with the program through the menu.
# Depending on the user's input, the corresponding function is executed.
